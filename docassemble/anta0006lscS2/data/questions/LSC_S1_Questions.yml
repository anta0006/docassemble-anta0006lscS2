question: Penalties for Exceeding the Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol (Below 0.08)
subquestion: |
  When you blow over the limit for the first time by this amount, the police have to issue you an expiation notice. When you are given this expiation notice, you have a few options. Typically, if you pay the fine, the matter ends without any license disqualification or conviction. The fine should be about $786 (as at 1 July 2022). However, if you want to challenge the offence, you can elect to be prosecuted, which means your case will be taken to court. It's important to note that if you're found guilty, your license will be automatically disqualified for three months and you may also recieve 4 demerit points and a $1100 fine. The disqualification is a mandatory requirement, meaning the court is obliged to impose this penalty regardless of the circumstances.
